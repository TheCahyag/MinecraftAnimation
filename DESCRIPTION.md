# Animations
Animations is a Sponge plugin that allows for the creation of frame-based animations. Animations was inspired by [VoxelTronix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_683155&feature=iv&src_vid=UW54ks4ttIo&v=Y06Xgk2YI0I) and its successor [VoxelMotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goueipj5RMM).
