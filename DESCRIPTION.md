# Animations
Animations is a Sponge plugin that allows for the creation of frame-based animations. Animations was inspired by [VoxelTronix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_683155&feature=iv&src_vid=UW54ks4ttIo&v=Y06Xgk2YI0I).

**Statement of purpose:** The Animations plugin is intended to be used by all on creative mode/building servers and by a select some on any other type of servers that want to make a build a little more special. The plugin is inherently dup-tastic and currently has no protections against that, hence the previous statement.
#### Permissions
Please see [this](https://github.com/TheCahyag/MinecraftAnimation/wiki/Permissions) permissions list to determine what permissions you will need for your server.
